Using opencv in C++

## I'm using Visual Studio Code as my IDE

__to run opencv program__
install the below extensions
```

```
ms-vscode.cmake-tools
```
* **make sure you have the CMakeLists.txt file**

* and to build go for the option <b>CMake: Build</b><br>
* and the executable will be stored on the build folder, you can run it just like you run any other c++ program, or you can use <b>CMake: Run Without Debugging<b> option that you will get in the command pallete after install the extensions
